IsLegalMoves or IsValidMove doesn't properly check if a move is legal or not

This is a problem starting from the chooseMove function inside the MachinePlayer

"LegalMoves.allLegalMoves(gameboard,machine_color).front();"

So check LegalMoves.java

Give a better score to more spread out coordinates on the board-
do this in the Evaluate method. Extract a move from the board, and 

make some helper in evaluate that calculates the distance between
them and then awards a higher score to more spread out pieces 


Once clause in Evaluate was wrong because you shouldn't just
make a score closer to -1 automatically be -1 because -1 means that
you've got a winning move for the opponent.
The same goes for the winning move for the player (1).                   
^ Now done   

Pieces already in the goals mean you get a higher score

pieces next to each other can be good, but avoid clusters
